            <p>
              I began my journey in web development with a strong passion for
              building digital products. Since 2021, Iâ€™ve grown into a
              full-stack developer, focusing on the React, Node.js, and MongoDB
              stack. I genuinely enjoy working across the entire application
              lifecycleâ€”from frontend to backendâ€”which has given me a deeper and
              more holistic understanding of software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work at two
              international companies, where I led and contributed to the
              architecture and development of several impactful web and mobile
              projects. Iâ€™m deeply passionate about what I do and continuously
              driven by the challenges and creativity that come with building
              software.
