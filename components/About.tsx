            I am a full-stack developer with 8+ years of experience,
            specializing in building beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly
            front-end applications, while also experienced in back-end
            development.

            Having a background in working for large companies allows me to
            focus not only on functionality but also on scalability and
            maintainability when implementing UI. I am proficient in modern
            technologies such as strong HTML, CSS, React, TypeScript, NodeJS,
            etc.

            In my current role, I led the reconstruction of the fund transaction
            reporting system, improving the team&lsquo;s development efficiency
            by 40%, and was responsible for communicating with the design
            department. I successfully integrated the front-end design token and
            reduced the number of front-end style bugs by 60%. I enjoy building
            systems from end to end and turning ideas into high-quality digital
            products.

            I love programming because I believe technology can make life better
