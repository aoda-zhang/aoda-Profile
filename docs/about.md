My software development journey started as a web developer. Since 2021, I have grown into a full-stack developer, focusing on the React, Node.js, and MongoDB technology stack. I really enjoy working on the entire application lifecycle from front-end to back-end, which has given me a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of software development.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work in two large international corporations and worked in the architecture design and development of multiple far-reaching web and mobile projects.

I have always been passionate about technical development work, which makes me feel that I am always at the forefront of this world.
