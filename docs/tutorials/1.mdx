## Motivation
In the first five years of my career as a software development engineer, 
I have been focusing on the front-end development field, 
wandering around the three major front-end frameworks, 
occasionally participating in some which framework is better, which is more powerful,
should the front-end use Redux or Mobx, or the newcomer Zustand, or being complained by the back-end guys "You front-end just draw pages!".<br/>
In the sixth year, I joined a foreign company and started my full-stack development career.<br/>
When I really got in touch with the full chain of software development from front-end to back-end, until the completion of delivery to users,
I realized the shortcomings of being a front-end developer before. I seemed to have never cared about the ins and outs of application data, nor thought about what adjustments I should make when my application reaches a certain scale.<br/>
Next, I will mainly use javascript to show how to complete a full-stack project step by step, and I hope to bring some help to you who are learning full-stack.<br/>
