## Check your NodeJs
Run this command to make sure you have downloaded the NodeJs in your local,
<b>this is the most important step here! </b><br/>
```zsh
node -v
```
Basicly you will get a specific node version like <b>v20.17.0</b> if you have already downloaded Nodejs.

## Migrate to pnpm ( optional,recommended )

If you are a JavaScript developer, you will know we have to choose a package manager to install our project
dependencies. I bet that most people used npm to be your first package manager, yes i did that too, but as time goes
by,i found it tooks more time to install with the project grow. i tried to find out a better one, yes,that is <b>pnpm</b>,it is really really 
faster than npm, mean while , the node_modules size is become less,plus, you can still use npm command to run pnpm. <b>I will highly recommend you give pnpm a try！！</b>.
it is time to consider to replace your package manager.I already have used pnpm 1 year, so far so good, i feeled luckly to choose it. <br/>

<b>Just run this command to install pnpm globally if you want to migrate to pnpm from npm</b>

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```
More about pnpm ,please refer to [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

## Create a new React project by Vite.

Currently, there are many different ways to create a React project, we will choose Vite to make it,
cause Vite aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

More about Vite, please refer to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

First, you should clone your project in your local, then <b>Just run this command to create your first React project</b>

```sh
pnpm create vite .
```
choose <b>React</b> and <b>TypeScript + SWC</b>.

At this step,you have created your React project successfuly,Cheers 🍻.

In the end,our project is like

```json
├─ tsconfig.node.json
├─ index.html
├─ tsconfig.app.json
├─ README.md
├─ .gitignore
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ eslint.config.js
├─ vite.config.ts
├─ src
│  ├─ App.tsx
│  ├─ main.tsx
│  ├─ App.css
│  ├─ index.css
│  ├─ vite-env.d.ts
│  └─ assets
│     └─ react.svg
└─ public
   └─ vite.svg
```
Then run <b>pnpm i</b> in your terminal to install all the dependencies, and Run <b>pnpm dev</b> to start your project .

Your project will oepn in your browser automatically when you click the link in your terminal .

Here it is 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 !!

## Make your project stronger!
At this point, you have successfully run your project locally, but it is NOT enough!

We all know,basically , we will set up some rules to make our project code quality to be stronger.

I will recommend that you shoul give <b>Biome</b> a try. NOT continue to use traditional way for Eslint + Prettier + StyleLint

More about Biome , please refer to [Biome](https://biomejs.dev).

<b>Follow below steps , you will get Biome !</b>

<b>1. Remove Eslint and Install Biome</b>

Firstly,Remove the eslint.config.js file and all the depends about eslint in package.json, Then run this below command

```zsh
pnpm add --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome
```
<b>2.Configureing Biome</b>

Create the <b>biome.json</b> in your project root,and copy the configuration into <b>biome.json</b>
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.8.3/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "formatWithErrors": true,
    "indentStyle": "space",
    "indentWidth": 2,
    "lineEnding": "lf",
    "lineWidth": 80,
    "attributePosition": "auto"
  },
  "organizeImports": { "enabled": true },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true,
      "nursery": {
        "recommended": true
      },
      "a11y": {
        "useButtonType": "warn"
      },
      "style": {
        "noNonNullAssertion": "warn"
      }
    },
    "ignore": ["./.vscode/*", "node_modules"]
  },
  "javascript": {
    "jsxRuntime": "reactClassic",
    "linter": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "double",
      "lineWidth": 120
    }
  },
  "json": {
    "linter": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "parser": {
      "allowComments": true
    }
  },
  "css": {
    "parser": { "cssModules": true },
    "formatter": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "linter": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}

```
You can flexibly change the configuration according to your project.more configurations please refer to .[Biome](https://biomejs.dev)

<b>3. Configureing command</b>

Add the command biome:check under scripts in your project root file package.json
```zsh
"biome:check": "biome check . --write --unsafe --files-ignore-unknown=true --no-errors-on-unmatched"
```
In the end, the package.json is like this 
```zsh
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "biome:check": "biome check . --write --unsafe --files-ignore-unknown=true --no-errors-on-unmatched",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
```

<b>4. Verif the biome result</b>

Just run the command biome:check in your terminal to make sure you have established biome successfully in your project .

That means you got it if you see something like this picture 
<img src="https://s1.locimg.com/2024/09/28/ebd8aa09233b4.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 9.52.02 PM.png" title="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 9.52.02 PM.png" />

<b>5. Install Vscode plugin</b>

Searching the plugin named <b>Biome</b>,then set up in your VSCode.

## Precheck before commit

At this point, we have established our stronger rules for our project , basically , biome will help us to check all the recommend rules,
we can make it by run the biome:check command .

But, let's think again , we don't want to do that every time we commit code manually ,it's a little 
troublesome, right ? 

so, how should we do that ?

ok, just imagine , if we can run the command biome:check automatically when we commit code , that would be a good
approach , that means we never need to run that shit command manually !!!!

so, that is it, that is <b>Husky + Lint-staged</b >, basically, Husky will automatically run the command that we configed when we commit code every time,
Lint-staged will pick up the code that you changed for this commit.

More , please refer to [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) and [Lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged#readme)

<b>Follow this below steps , you will get it !</b>

1. Install Husky and Lint-staged

```zsh
pnpm add --save-dev husky lint-staged

```
2. Add Husky and Lint-staged option

Add those options in package.json,Run <b>pnpm i</b> again !

```json
"scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky",
    "lint-staged": "tsc && lint-staged"
  },
"lint-staged": {
    "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md}": ["pnpm biome:check"]
  },
```
Then you will find the .husky folder in the root

3. Configure the pre-commit git hooks

Add the pre-commit file and type <b>pnpm lint-staged</b>

<img src="https://s1.locimg.com/2024/09/30/23605a4e7b3ed.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 11.19.22 AM.png" title="Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 11.19.22 AM.png" />

Now,it will automatically check when we commit code every time, Awesome !!

## Next section

Until now , we have totally completed our react project set up work, next section, let's drive deeper into react 
router and see <b>how can we handle react pages and layout</b> , let's go !
