## Check your NodeJs
Firstly, Just run the command in your temla to make sure you have downloaded Nodejs in your
local,this is the most important first step. <br/>
```zsh
node -v
```
and
```zsh
npm -v
```
## Creating a new react project
Secondly,run this recommend to create you amazing react project

```zsh
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```
I know someone will say CRA is ,we should use create-nextjs-app to install our react project, that is react office recommend
but hold on , what we want is a react project , why we need to use the nextjs,oterwise when you used nextjs, you will find 
it has more breaken change , that is not what we want. so in my option, CRA is still the most useful way to creat your react project

## Migrate to pnpm

Then i will recommend useing pnpm as your package manager,i know you have used npm or yarn many years,
and you love them,but trust me , just give pnpm a try, please,it is faster, it is mini for node_modules,more information please visit [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
