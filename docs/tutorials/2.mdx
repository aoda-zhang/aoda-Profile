## Check your NodeJs
Run this command to make sure you have downloaded the NodeJs in your local,
<b>this is the most important step here! </b><br/>
```zsh
node -v
```
Basicly you will get a specific node version like <b>v20.17.0</b> if you have already downloaded Nodejs.

## Migrate to pnpm ( optional,recommended )

If you are a JavaScript developer, you will know we have to choose a package manager to install our project
dependencies. I bet that most people used npm to be your first package manager, yes i did that too, but as time goes
by,i found it tooks more time to install with the project grow. i tried to find out a better one, yes,that is <b>pnpm</b>,it is really really 
faster than npm, mean while , the node_modules size is become less,plus, you can still use npm command to run pnpm. <b>I will highly recommend you give pnpm a try！！</b>.
it is time to consider to replace your package manager.I already have used pnpm 1 year, so far so good, i feeled luckly to choose it. <br/>

<b>Just run this command to install pnpm globally if you want to migrate to pnpm from npm</b>

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```
<b>More about pnpm ,please refer to [here](https://pnpm.io).</b>

## Create a new React project by Vite.

Currently, there are many different ways to create a React project, we will choose Vite to make it,
cause Vite aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

More about Vite, please refer to [here](https://vitejs.dev).

First, you should clone your project in your local, then <b>Just run this command to create your first React project</b>

```sh
pnpm create vite .
```
choose <b>React</b> and <b>TypeScript + SWC</b>.

At this step,you have created your React project successfuly,Cheers 🍻.

In the end,our project is like

```json
├─ tsconfig.node.json
├─ index.html
├─ tsconfig.app.json
├─ README.md
├─ .gitignore
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ eslint.config.js
├─ vite.config.ts
├─ src
│  ├─ App.tsx
│  ├─ main.tsx
│  ├─ App.css
│  ├─ index.css
│  ├─ vite-env.d.ts
│  └─ assets
│     └─ react.svg
└─ public
   └─ vite.svg
```
Then run <b>pnpm i</b> in your terminal to install all the dependencies, and Run <b>pnpm dev</b> to start your project .

Your project will oepn in your browser automatically when you click the link in your terminal .

Here it is 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 !!

## Make your project stronger!
At this point, you have successfully run your project locally, but it is NOT enough!

We all know,basically , we will set up some rules to make our project code quality to be stronger.

I will recommend that you shoul give <b>Biome</b> a try. NOT continue to use Eslint + Prettier + StyleLint

<b>More about Biome , please refer to [here](https://biomejs.dev).</b>

### Follow below steps , you will get Biome !

<b>1. Install Biome</b>

```zsh
pnpm add --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome
```
<b>2.Configureing Biome</b>
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.8.3/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "formatWithErrors": true,
    "indentStyle": "space",
    "indentWidth": 2,
    "lineEnding": "lf",
    "lineWidth": 80,
    "attributePosition": "auto"
  },
  "organizeImports": { "enabled": true },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true,
      "nursery": {
        "recommended": true
      },
    },
    "ignore": [
      "./.vscode/*",
      "node_modules"
    ]
  },
  "javascript": {
    "jsxRuntime": "reactClassic",
    "linter": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "double",
      "lineWidth": 120
    }
  },
  "json": {
    "linter": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "parser": {
      "allowComments": true
    }
  },
  "css": {
    "parser": { "cssModules": true },
    "formatter": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "linter": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}

```
You can flexibly change the configuration according to your project.more configurations please refer to .[Biome](https://biomejs.dev)

<b>3. Configureing command</b>

Add the command biome:check under scripts in your project root file package.json
```zsh
"biome:check": "biome check . --write --unsafe --files-ignore-unknown=true --no-errors-on-unmatched"
```
In the end, the package.json is like this 
```zsh
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "biome:check": "biome check . --write --unsafe --files-ignore-unknown=true --no-errors-on-unmatched",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
```

<b>4. 安装VSCode插件</b>

在你的VSCode插件扩展中搜索Biome并安装,并且按照说明在你的项目中进行设置即可.
